# MyCORS Sample Application: React

## Introduction

MyCORS is a DocuSign sample application that shows how to construct Single Page Applications (SPAs) that leverage DocuSign support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This sample application is created using React.js. You can find a live instance running at [https://mycors.sampleapps.docusign.com/](https://mycors.sampleapps.docusign.com/).

MyCORS demonstrates the following:

1. **Authentication** with DocuSign via [Implicit Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/implicit/).
2. **Send Insurance Card:**
   This example uses the DocuSign [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/) to request a signature by email with [Document Generation](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/request-signature-email-document-generation/) using a predefined template in docx format.
3. **Know Your Customer:**
   This example uses the DocuSign [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/) to request a signature through your application using [Embedded Signing](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/request-signature-in-app-embedded/).

## Prerequisites

- Create a DocuSign [Developer Account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/).
- Create an application on the [Apps and Keys](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=appsAndKeys) page.
- Set Authentication Method for your application to Implicit Grant. Under User Application: Is your application able to securely store a client secret, select No.

- Add redirect URIs:
  - `{ PROTOCOL }://{ DOMAIN }/`
  - `{ PROTOCOL }://{ DOMAIN }/oauth-response-handler/`
  - `{ PROTOCOL }://{ DOMAIN }/ds-response-handler/`
- Update CORS Configuration:

  - Origin URLs: `{ PROTOCOL }://{ DOMAIN }`
  - Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT

- Installed and configured [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Installed and configured [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Variables configuration

Create a copy of the file .env.example, save the copy as .env, and fill in the data:

- REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID - integration key of the application created in section "Create an application on the Apps and Keys page" above (GUID)
- REACT_APP_OAUTH_RETURN_URL - internal redirection URL that is used during the authentication
- REACT_APP_DS_RETURN_URL - internal redirection URL that is used during the enbedded signing process
